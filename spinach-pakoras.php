                        <h3>Preparation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Because we're frying the pakoras, make sure your oil is fully heated before adding each group of balls into it.
                            To test, drop a little piece of mixture into the oil, and if it starts to fry immediately (not sink to the bottom), the oil is ready.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Directions</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <img src="img/recipes/pakoras1.jpg" alt="Bowl with pakora ingredients ready to be mixed." />
                                <h6>1 - Ready the Ingredients.</h6>
                                Make sure the spinach is finely chopped; onions very finely diced & garlic, chili, are very finely minced.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <img src="img/recipes/pakoras2.jpg" alt="Bowl with pakora ingredients ready to be mixed." />
                                <h6>2 - Heat the Oil, Make the Mix.</h6>
                                Begin heating 1/2 inch of oil in a pan, on medium heat.
                                While the oil heats up, thoroughly mix all the remaining ingredients in a bowl.
                                Taste the mixture and adjust as desired.
                                If the mix sits for too long and goes runny, just add a little more chickpea flour.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <img src="img/recipes/pakoras3.jpg" alt="Example of making the balls with your hands." />
                                <h6>3 - Start the Frying.</h6>
                                Once the oil has full heated, it's time to make the balls.
                                Using a tablespoon (or your fingers) scoop up the mixture and make 1 1/2 inch round balls, then add them to the fryer.
                                Keep turning them around in the fryer to ensure all sides are cooked, until they are golden brown.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <img src="img/recipes/pakoras4.jpg" alt="Golden brown pakoras in the fryer." />
                                <h6>4 - Drain the Pakoras.</h6>
                                Once they are golden brown,
                                remove the pakoras and place them on paper towels to drain excess oil.
                                Serve hot or warm with a chutney, lime wedges, or by themselves!
