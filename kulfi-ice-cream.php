                        <p>
                            To more easily skin the almonds and the shelled pistachios, soak them in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.
                            To ground the green cardamom seeds, you can use a mortal & pestle, coffee grinder or small blender.

                                <h6>1 - Start the Mixture.</h6>
                                In a bowl, mix all ingredients EXCEPT the whipping cream (and garnish).
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <h6>2 - Whip the Cream.</h6>
                                Whip the cream until slightly stiff, then gently fold into the mixture.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <h6>3 - Pour into Molds.</h6>
                                Put mixture into 4 evenly sized plastic or metal molds and then cover.
                                Freeze the mixture, ideally for 4 hours.
                            </li>

                                <h6>4 - Serve the Kulfis.</h6>
                                Remove kulfis a few minutes before serving (they should not be served when hard).
                                To remove kulfis from a mold, you can briefly dip the mold in warm water first.
                                Garnish with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of coconut.
                            </li>
